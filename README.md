THEORY

An operator is a symbol that operates on a value to perform specific mathematical or logical computations. They form the foundation of any programming language. In C++, we have built-in operators to provide the required functionality.

An operator operates the operands. For example,

int c = a + b; Here, ‘+’ is the addition operator. ‘a’ and ‘b’ are the operands that are being ‘added’


ALGORITHM

-Enter Your PRN
1.It declares two integer variables prn and digit to store the PRN and individual digits, respectively.

2.It prompts the user to enter their PRN.

3.It enters a while loop that continues as long as prn is greater than 0.

4.Inside the loop:

5.It calculates the last digit of prn using the modulo operator (%) and assigns it to the digit variable.

6.It prints the digit on a new line.

7.It divides prn by 10 to remove the last digit.

8.The loop continues until all digits of the PRN have been extracted and printed.


-Enter marks of each subjects and find the grade based on average
1.It declares integer variables sub1, sub2, sub3, sub4, sub5 to store the marks of five subjects, and variables sum and average to store the sum of marks and the average, respectively.

2.It prompts the user to enter marks for each subject.

3.It calculates the sum of the marks from all five subjects.

4.It calculates the average by dividing the sum by 5.

5.It uses a series of if and else if statements to determine the grade based on the average:

6.If the average is greater than or equal to 90, it assigns the grade "O."

7.If the average is between 85 and 89, it assigns the grade "A+."

8.If the average is between 75 and 84, it assigns the grade "A."

9.If the average is between 65 and 74, it assigns the grade "B+."

10.If the average is between 55 and 64, it assigns the grade "B."

11.If the average is between 40 and 54, it assigns the grade "C."

12.If none of the above conditions are met, it assigns the grade "Student has failed."

13.It prints the grade based on the average.
